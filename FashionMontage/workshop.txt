description=[h1]Update: Modded Clothing Support![/h1]
description=I have created a framework to make it easy for modders to add new clothing to the dropdowns. Please encourage clothing modders to make their items compatible with Fashion Montage!
description=
description=I also made the Randomizer behave more randomly, and made some other changes that [i]might[/i] resolve the errors that a few people have been reporting. However, I haven't actually seen those errors firsthand or know what's causing them, so it's hard to say for sure.

description=Now you can try on all the clothes you want at character gen, so spin up that Sixpence None the Richer album and prepare to get fabulous this armageddon. Flak armor and riot gear are so hot right now.

description=[h1]Instructions[/h1]
description=Pretty straightforward, this mod simply adds every vanilla clothing item to the selection screen at the start of the game, including backpacks! Great for breathing a little bit more personality and backstory into your character.
description=
description=It can also add clothing from other mods, but it's up to those modders to add compatibility.
description=Modders: This is fairly easy to do; check the lua/client/Definitions folder for a template file.
