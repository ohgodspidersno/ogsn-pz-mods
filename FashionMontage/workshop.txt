title=Fashion Montage - Start with any outfit [41.47]
description=[h1]Important: If you are seeing error messages[/h1]
description=If you have used a mod that required you to manually update your FileGuidTable.xml file (like SWAT Pack) then you might see error messages popping up whenever the devs update the game.
description=Fashion Montage is [i]not[/i] causing these errors, even though it is producing the messages. The errors are actually being caused by a FileGuidTable.xml that needs to be fixed.
description=Please visit the other mod's workshop page for more information on how to fix this, and to report those errors.

description=[h2]Modded Clothing Support![/h2]
description=I have created a framework to make it easy for modders to add new clothing to the dropdowns. Please encourage clothing modders to make their items compatible with Fashion Montage!

description=[h2]Description[/h2]
description=Now you can try on all the clothes you want at character gen, so spin up that Sixpence None the Richer album and prepare to get fabulous this armageddon. Flak armor and riot gear are so hot right now.

description=[h2]Instructions[/h2]
description=Pretty straightforward, this mod simply adds every vanilla clothing item to the selection screen at the start of the game, including backpacks! Great for breathing a little bit more personality and backstory into your character.
description=
description=It can also add clothing from other mods, but it's up to those modders to add compatibility.
description=If those mods asked you to modify FileGuidTable.xml, make sure to keep it up to date with the one listed on the mods' pages.
description=
description=Modders: This is fairly easy to do; check the lua/client/Definitions folder for a template file.

description=[h2]Important Notes[/h2]
description=[list]
description=[*] This is for the beta branch (IWBUMS version 41.47)
description=[*] Compatible with all other mods, with one exception: Mods that add clothing items can cause issues if they are not kept up to date with the latest version of Project Zomboid. Make sure that the other mod is actively maintained, and make all necessary changes to FileGuidTable.xml that the other mod tells you to do.

description=[h2]Troubleshooting[/h2]
description=[olist]
description=[*] If you are using, or have [b]ever[/b] used, a mod that asked you to manually change a file called [u]FileGuidTable.xml[/u], this can cause problems if you do not keep it updated.
description=[list]
description=[*]If you're using a clothing mod, make sure you have the most up-to-date version of FileGuidTable.xml that the other modder has listed on the mod page.
description=[*]If you are still having troubles, restore the vanilla xml file (right click on the game in Steam > click on "Local Files" Tab, and then click the "Verify File Integrity" button). After that disable mods that add clothing. This will give you a clean slate and you can try to re-install the clothing mods from there.
description=[/list]
description=[*] Check to make sure you are playing version 41. If you are not sure, then you probably aren't.
description=[*] If it still does not work, please post your modlist in the bugs discussion page.
