description=[h1]Update: Modded Clothing Support![/h1]
description=I have created a framework to make it easy for modders to add new clothing to the dropdowns. Please encourage clothing modders to make their items compatible with Fashion Montage!
description=
description=I also made the Randomizer behave more randomly, and made some other changes that [i]might[/i] resolve the errors that a few people have been reporting. However, I haven't actually seen those errors firsthand or know what's causing them, so it's hard to say for sure.

description=[h1]Instructions[/h1]
description=Pretty straightforward, this mod simply adds every vanilla clothing item to the selection screen at the start of the game, including backpacks! Great for breathing a little bit more personality and backstory into your character.
description=
description=It can also add clothing from other mods, but it's up to those modders to add compatibility.
description=Modders: This is fairly easy to do; check the lua/client/Definitions folder for a template file.
