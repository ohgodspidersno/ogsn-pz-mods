title=Orphanage for Abandoned Mods [41.47]
description=[h1]Update: Coffee Works![/h1]
description=The devs just dropped build 41.47 which fixed the problems with coffee that were in 41.46
description=I have also made all adjustments necessary to these mods to make them work nicely:
description=[list]
description=[*]Organized Storage 4-packs of coffee confirmed working
description=[*]Good Caffeine submod has been updated/tweaked. Coffee once again comes in jar-sized units, like in the current vanilla build. However, it increases the number of servings, and also boosts the normal strength of coffee by 50%. To discourage you from eating it raw, I increased the happiness and dehydration debuffs, which you can avoid by brewing a cup. I hope you will find it an improvement
description=[*]Good Caffeine and Organized Storage are compatible, no patch necessary.

description=A collection of other people's mods that have been temporarily or permanently abandoned.
description=These are re-uploads that I actively maintain. I keep them compatible with the latest IWBUMS branch, and also fix any bugs and mod conflicts I find.
