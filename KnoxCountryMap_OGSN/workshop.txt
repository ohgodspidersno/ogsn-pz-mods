description=[b][u]Q: You misspelled 'County"[/u][/b]
description=
description=A: It's actually called Knox Country in the game! I thought it was County, too, until the good folks on the Discord channel corrected me. There is a real life Knox County in Kentucky but it's in a  totally different part of the state.

description=The game area most closely aligns with the real life counties of Meade, Hardin, Bullitt, and Breckenridge.
