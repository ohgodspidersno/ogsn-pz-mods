title=Reasonable Abundance - Better Sandbox Settings for Foraged Items
description=[h1]Fixes "Nature's Abundance" Sandbox Setting[/h1]
description=
description=In the vanilla game, scavenge zones refill ridiculously quickly (a few days) regardless of what setting you choose for "Nature's Abundance". The setting only adjusts how much you actually find per visit, but that hardly matters when zones refill so fast that you never need to walk further than a few hundred years to find a fresh spot.

description=How dreary!

description=This mod makes the Nature's Abundance setting instead affect how long it takes for a zone to refill.
description=Now you might have to actually leave your backyard to find greener pastures!
