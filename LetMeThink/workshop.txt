title=Let Me Think - Open Menus and Queue Tasks While Paused [41.36+]
description=[h1]Description[/h1]
description=Project Zomboid isn't a fast-paced shooter or a precision platformer. You should be allowed some time to open menus and queue up tasks for your character while the game is paused.

description=This mod makes it so that most right-click context menus now work even when the game is paused.

description=[h1]Important - What This Mod Does, and What It Doesn't Do[/h1]
description=To clarify, this does not let your character actually [i]do[/i] anything while the game is paused. It just lets you add tasks to the queue. Your character won't actually start doing them until you unpause.
