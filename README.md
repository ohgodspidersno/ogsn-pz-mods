#Oh God Spiders No's Project Zomboid Mods
##Unglamorous QoL Stuff
My mods are mostly intended to fix things that seem like old forgotten bugs, or to add new quality-of-life fixes and UI improvements.

##Pardon the mess
The uploader prevents you from putting .git folders inside your mod folder so it seemed simpler to just put them all in one repo. It's just me here, so that means I'm not bothering with squashing, branching, or rebasing. I'm just writing that because I want anyone reading this to know that ordinarily I keep my git game tight.

##TODO List
###Vanilla Food Fixes
1. Mark public once it seems safe to

###Knox Country World Map
1. Might be missing some turn-offs on highway north of Rosewood.
1. Make secret version of map only appear in some places, but at a higher rate
    1. Small chance in police cars
    1. Slightly higher chance in forest ranger cars
    1. Small chance in military barracks and buildings
    1. Guaranteed in radio news van
    1. Guaranteed in Mystery Machine if that mod is loaded
    1. Guaranteed in Military vehicles if those mods are loaded

###Lockpicking
1. Fix bug described here: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2056238799/2264690481984469813/
1. Add car lockpicking

##Ideas for New Mods
Might pursue these...

###Even Better Literature Sorting
1. Same as Book Collection for the most part
1. Add a single space in front of all magazines so they sort second
1. Remove 'the' from all titles.
1. Name maps to be "Map of ____" instead of "___ Map" so that they group together.
1. Be sure to add new magazines from other mods
1. Will need to load last in order to fix stuff changed by other mods

###Mental State Affects Reading Speed
1. Make reading speed be affected by panic, exhaustion, fatigue, hunger, illness, etc.

###Walk While Reading
1. Base it on bookworm trait
1. Make it possible without a trait, but make it severely limit your sight and hearing radius, and you don't read at full speed either.

###Pass Out if Too Tired
1. Once your exhaustion hits absolute zero, and you are not panicking, there is a small chance every tick that you might fall asleep against your will.

###More Map Symbols
1. Car
1. Loot bag
1. Gun
1. Different circles

###Use Metalworking to Turn Barrels Into Rain Collectors
1. Oil Barrel or Garbage Can + Metal Sheet = Rain Collector

###Rename More Things
1. Lighters
1. Dolls, Bears, Spiffos
1. Weapons

###Misc Item Fixes
1. Shouldn't be able to burn inflammable clothes like welding masks and helmets
1. Gather gunpowder from .38 ammo (and any others that are missing)
1. A single bullet shouldn't weigh something like 50% as much as a box containing 24 bullets.
1. Sport batteries spawning inside standard cars
1. Maps should be flammable
1. Once bags appear when held on off-hand, make duffel bags better, but unequippable on back

###That Looks Heavy Better Take Off Our Clothes, Said No One
Increases the weight reduction of clothing that you're wearing. Wearing shoes and clothing doesn't weigh you down in real life, if anything it increases your carrying capacity.

###Mystery Machine
Add the Scooby Doo van into the game using the art given to me by another modder

###Remove Fuzzy Distortion Audio Filter from Hard of Hearing
Hard of hearing should lower your hearing range, obviously, but it doesn't need to lower the player's enjoyment of the game by adding a fuzzy filter to every sound effect.



##Current List of Mods

###Fashion Montage
Pick whatever clothing you want at character gen

###Lockpicking! Just. Lockpicking.
Fork of FMJ's Lockpicking, but you aren't forced to use all the other unrelated mods in order to get the lockpicking. Plus bugfixes and balance improvements.

###Knox Country World Map
Adds an in-game map item of the whole game world. It's like the other street atlases you find scattered around the game.

###Let Me Think
Makes it so that you still do things like browse menus, queue tasks, etc. while the game is paused. Your character then does queued tasks after you un-pause the game.

###TV Shows Still Grant XP in Fast-Forward
Makes it so that you don't get less XP from a TV show if you watch it while in fast-forward. This bug occurs because in fast-forward XP ticks seem to overlap and blend and you miss some. My mod fixes this by making the show grant all the experience in one tick.

###Spears: Twine & Leather Strips as Binding, Chipped Stones as Spearheads
Lets you use twine and leather to attach spearheads, instead of just duct tape. Also lets you use chipped stones as spearheads.

###Unsterilize Rags
Lets you downgrade sterilized rags to ripped sheets in case you need to use them for other recipes that need ripped sheets.

###Vanilla Food Fixes
A collection of fixes to obvious bugs and what I consider to be oversights in several foods and recipes.


##Deprecated Mods
Some mods aren't in the latest master anymore because they were abandoned or folded into other mods. But they still exist in the repo if you go back far enough.

###Folded into Vanilla Food Fixes
- Cook With Herbs
- Herbs Rot
- Past and Rice Rot
- War on Beans
