title=Spears: Twine and Leather Binding, Chipped Stone Spearheads
description=[h1]Update: Bugfix and Optional Improvements to Vanilla Calculation of Spear Quality[/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*] Mod now fixes vanilla game's math error that unfairly caps the durability of spears at 50%
description=[*] Optional submod has been added, with more significant changes[Beta version, so expect bugs, and please report any you find!]
description=[list]
description=[*] Handy trait is now factored into the spearmaking calculations, essentially boosting your woodworking level in all calculations
description=[*] In addition to higher durability, high woodworking skill now also boosts maximum durability.
description=[*] Very high woodworking skill boosts maximum damage
description=[*] Twine, leather strips, and duct tape are each factored into calculations differently from one another
description=[list]
description=[*] Duct tape provides a flat bonus, ideal for characters with low crafting levels
description=[*] Twine provides a bonus that scales with crafting skill, ideal for high level crafting characters
description=[*] Leather strips, being abundant and easy to find, offer no bonus
description=[/list]
description= The quality of spearhead has a bigger impact on the quality of your spear than in the vanilla code. For instance, machete spearheads will now outperform scissor spearheads to the same degree that machetes outperform scissors.
