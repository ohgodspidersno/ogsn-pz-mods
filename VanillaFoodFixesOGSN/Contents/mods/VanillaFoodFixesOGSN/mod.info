name=[DEPRECATED] Vanilla Food Fixes BETA (v1.0 is now available)
id=VanillaFoodFixesOGSN
description=This has been folded into my other, more polished mod, "Vanilla Food Fixes," which provides many more bug fixes and light-weight, common sense improvements to the vanilla food items and recipes. See Steam page for more details.
description=I will leave this mod on the workshop in order not to break existing save games.
